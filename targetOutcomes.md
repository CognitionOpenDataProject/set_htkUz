For this article you should focus on the findings reported in section 2.2. Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Infants’ looking times in the main experiment ( Fig. 3, Table 1) were compared by an ANOVA with age (7.5 or 8.5 months), condition (side- or middle-contact), and event (wide- or narrow-box) as between-subjects factors. The analysis yielded a significant main effect of event, F(1, 56) = 26.25, p < 0.0001, a significant Condition × Event interaction, F(1, 56) = 5.18, p < 0.05, and, critically, a significant Age × Condition × Event interaction, F(1, 56) = 7.13, p < 0.01, ηp2 = 0.11. As predicted, planned comparisons revealed that at 7.5 months, infants in both the side-contact condition, F(1, 56) = 9.73, p < 0.005, Cohen’s d = 1.38, and the middle-contact condition, F(1, 56) = 12.32, p < 0.001, d = 1.83, looked reliably longer if shown the wide-box as opposed to the narrow-box event; at 8.5 months, infants in the side-contact condition again looked reliably longer if shown the wide-box as opposed to the narrow-box event, F(1, 56) = 18.33, p < 0.0001, d = 2.00, but infants in the middle-contact condition looked equally at the two events, F(1, 56) < 1. The two age groups differed reliably in their looking times at the wide-box event in the middle-contact condition, F(1, 56) = 7.96, p < 0.01, d = 1.43, but not the side-contact condition, F(1, 56) = 1.16, p > 0.25; there were no significant differences for the narrow-box event, both Fs(1, 56) < 1.84, ps > 0.20.
